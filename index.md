The inundation of data generation technologies, along with progress in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and increasing privacy concerns, has prompted research into techniques for both federated and privacy preserving AI. Federated Learning (FL) allows multiple clients to collaborate in training AI models without sharing data while privacy preserving AI places further emphasis on protecting client data. To date, federated and privacy preserving AI are primarily driven by consumer demand for fast and accurate analysis on personal devices which may contain sensitive data. In the HPC domain, FL interest has grown in the areas of health analytics and coordination across experimental facilities. This latter form of FL relaxes traditional assumptions such as including far fewer clients while increasing the amount of computational power available which poses new and unsolved problems. This workshop aims to highlight research in all aspects of federated and privacy preserving AI for HPC, machine learning, and scientific participants. Broad goals would be to consolidate the community around a core set of objectives or metrics and foster new collaborations.

## Workshop Scope:

Our workshop will aim to gather stakeholders from academia, federal agencies, industry, and national laboratories to present state-of-the-art research and technologies for federated and privacy-preserving AI in HPC. We will lead and facilitate discussions on problems facing and solutions discovered for developing and researching federated learning systems, such as balancing the trade-offs between model accuracy, data privacy, and overall computational performance. The workshop will include presentations on attacks on data privacy in distributed systems, differential privacy, domain and task-specific algorithms, etc. as well as real-world applications of privacy preserving AI. Other questions for this burgeoning community include (1) what are potential collaborative and open HPC platforms and technologies for researchers and application engineers to leverage; (2) what are key metrics of success for these applications; and (3) how will the long-term security of these systems be maintained and ensured.
